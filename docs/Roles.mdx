# Roles

## File: types.tsx

These are the roles that exist in keycloak used to differentiate the different users permissions. Use the enum 'Roles' (found in the types file) to get a role, f.ex. Roles.Oslo

## List of roles

<Playground>
  {() => {
     Roles = {
      Oslo: 'reg_employee',
      Partner: 'partner',
      Ambassador: 'reuse_station',
    }
    return null;
  }}
</Playground>
