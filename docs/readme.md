# Docz documentation

The files in this folder is an incomplete and outdated documentation of components in the project.

The documentation setup was initially done using [Docz](https://www.docz.site). 
This setup was deactivated in january 2021, as this kind of documentation was (temporarily) de-prioritized.

The setup files was archived in the adjacent `docz-setup` folder, and can be used to restore the setup.
