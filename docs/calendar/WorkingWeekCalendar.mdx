## Props

<Props of={WorkingWeekCalendar} />

## Usage

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const date = new Date();
    const min = new Date(date.setHours(7, 0, 0, 0));
    const max = new Date(date.setHours(20, 0, 0, 0));
    return (
        <WorkingWeekCalendar date={new Date()} min={min} max={max} />
    )
  }}
</Playground>
