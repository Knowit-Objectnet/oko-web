# Calendar - Gutter

The gutter is the 'column' on the left side of the calendar that displays the time. The gutter has a 'TitleGroup' that has the same height as a ColumnTitle, but it contains nothing, it is only there (or not there) to make sure everything has an even height.

## Props

<Props of={Gutter} />
